description: Bring a GNOME Shell extension to a new GNOME Shell version - read gnome-shell and mutter at the old and new tags, check every shell import and private reach, fix what moved for the new version alone, record what was read where, and claim the version in metadata.json only once the extension has run on it. Use when a new GNOME release is out or near, when a version is asked for, or when an issue says the extension breaks on one.

Port to: $ARGUMENTS

A version is claimed in `shell-version` only once the extension has **run** on it.
Reading the sources says what to fix; it does not earn the claim. `main` claims only the
versions that boot on the user's machines: once the new one does, the old one leaves
`shell-version`, and its users keep the last release made for it. No code detects or
branches on the shell version (`.claude/rules/simplicity.md`). A typical finding: on 51,
`Clutter.get_default_backend()` and `navigate_from_event()` are gone.

## 1. The sources, once per machine

```bash
K=${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/gnome-ext-sources
for p in gnome-shell mutter; do
    [ -d $K/$p ] || git clone --filter=blob:none https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/$p.git $K/$p
    git -C $K/$p fetch --tags -q
done
git -C $K/gnome-shell tag -l '51.*'      # the tags that exist
```

Read a file at a tag with `git -C $K/gnome-shell show 51.0:js/ui/panel.js`, and what
changed with `git -C $K/gnome-shell diff 50.0 51.0 -- js/ui/panel.js`. The old tag is the
newest version `shell-version` claims; for a version not yet released, the newest
`.alpha`/`.beta`/`.rc` tag or `main`, said as such. The tags are also how to read the
shell a machine runs: `gresource` (to list the installed `libshell` resources) is often
not installed, and the tag matching `gnome-shell --version` holds the same files.

## 2. What the extension depends on

- **The porting guide**: https://gjs.guide/extensions/upgrading/gnome-shell-<N>.html
  (WebFetch), and the guides for any versions skipped.
- **Every shell import**: `grep -rn "resource:///org/gnome/shell/" src/`, each module and
  each name taken from it, checked at the new tag.
- **Every private reach**: the repository's list (`docs/private-api.md`, or its CLAUDE.md
  section), then `grep -rnE "\._[a-zA-Z]" src/` against shell objects and anything wrapped
  with `InjectionManager` or a monkey-patch, to catch reaches the list missed.
- **Mutter, Clutter, St and GJS**: methods called on them, in mutter's `clutter/`, `src/`
  and the shell's `src/st/` at the new tag; GJS and GLib from the new platform's release
  notes.
- **Constants the extension restates** (animation times, sizes): still equal.
- The preferences: libadwaita and GTK versions the new release ships.

## 3. Fix

On a branch per version (`port/<N>`), with an issue per breakage. Each fix is written for
the new version alone: no feature tests, no fallback to the old API, no comment naming
versions. `make check`. If `main` holds changes the old version's users should still
get, release them (`gnome-ext:release`) before the port merges. Boot the change on the
new version (the nested shell, both machines where they differ: the kit's two-machine
rule).

## 4. Record what was read

`docs/compatibility.md`: which tags were read, what changed and how the extension copes,
dated. `docs/private-api.md`: every reach, with the tags it was read at and what breaks
when it moves. A repository without these files records the same in its CLAUDE.md's
private-API section.

## 5. Boot it, then claim it

Only a shell of version N running the extension earns `"N"` in `shell-version`: a
machine on that release, a VM, or a nested shell built from that version. Name where it
was booted, with `gnome-shell --version`, in `compatibility.md`. Enable, use every
feature the README promises, `stop` + `start` once, and read the logs: no errors with the
extension's prefix.

Then `shell-version` is `["N"]` alone: the old version goes in the same change.
If nothing can run N yet, the port waits on a branch, and `main` stays on the version
that boots. Never claim a future version.

## 6. Land and report

Through the loop (pull request "Fixes #N" per breakage, or one for the port with every
issue listed), then report: tags read, what broke and how each was fixed, where it was
booted, and whether the version was claimed.
