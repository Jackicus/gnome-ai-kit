name: nested-shell
description: Drive a GNOME Shell extension in a throwaway nested GNOME Shell, mirrored live on the user's desktop - start it, reload into it, click, press keys, screenshot regions, read the PNGs, read its logs, then stop it. Use whenever a change to an extension must be SEEN (layout, colour, spacing, motion end-states, the preferences window) or needs a fresh shell start (extension.js, metadata.json, the schema, a new UUID). Read the repository's own drive-extension skill too, for its coordinates and commands.

What to check: $ARGUMENTS

The extension draws into the shell, not into a window, so a visual change is verified only
by looking at it. This is the generic loop; the repository's
`.claude/skills/drive-extension/SKILL.md` adds where things are on its screen, its own
commands (a player, a virtual pad, demo data) and what must never be pressed. Read both
before the first `start`. The rules in the kit's `live-session.md` hold throughout.

`./scripts/nested.sh` is the kit's, the same in every repository; `./scripts/nested.sh help`
lists it with this repository's own commands (from `./scripts/nested.d/`). A repository
without `./scripts/ext.conf` still runs its own older script: its CLAUDE.md says how it
differs.

## The loop

```bash
S=<your scratchpad>/<repository>          # shots go there, never into the repository; a folder
                                          # per repository, since sessions and agents share it
./scripts/nested.sh start                 # ~2 s; the extension is ACTIVE when it returns
./scripts/nested.sh do "say Baseline" "shot $S/before.png"
# … edit src/ …
./scripts/nested.sh reload
./scripts/nested.sh do "say After the change" "shot $S/after.png"
./scripts/nested.sh stop                  # closes the mirror; read its last line
```

Then **Read the PNGs** and say what actually differs. If nothing visibly changed, say so;
never assume an edit worked.

- **`start`** reuses a running shell. Its settings are its own (only this extension
  enabled, the user's look copied in), kept between starts; `--clean` resets them.
  `--headless` skips the mirror; `--monitors N` puts N monitors side by side; `WxH` sets
  each (default 1600x900); `--stand-in` runs it over stand-in data, for shots that are
  kept (below).
- **`reload`** recompiles the schema and disables and enables the extension inside the
  nested shell (under `--stand-in`, after copying `src/` again). It does not re-read
  `extension.js` or `metadata.json`: those need `stop` + `start`.
- **`stop` + `start` at least once before calling a change done.** Only a fresh start runs
  the enable path and the first frame as a login does.
- **It stops itself** after 10 minutes with no `nested.sh` command (`NESTED_IDLE=<seconds>`
  at `start`, `0` = never), a backstop, not the plan.
- **It runs the link's entry point**, `./scripts/dev-extension.js`. To try the shipped
  `src/extension.js` (which logs nothing on success), point the installed `extension.js`
  link at it for one `start`, then point it back.

## One call per interaction: `do`

`do` runs its steps over one connection and input session and stops at the first that
fails, so a whole walkthrough is one tool call.

| Step | Does |
|---|---|
| `say TEXT` | A banner in the nested shell (≤ ~40 characters, no apostrophes: steps are shell-split). One before every step the user should follow. |
| `click X Y` / `move X Y` | Click or hover at desktop coordinates. |
| `scroll X Y up\|down [N]` | N wheel notches with the pointer there. |
| `key KEYSYM` | `Escape`, `Return`, arrows, `F1`–`F12`, one character, or a chord (`Super+Page_Down`). |
| `wait SECS` | Let something land: ~1 s after the overview opens or closes, ~0.6 s after a pop-up. |
| `shot [FILE [X Y W H]]` | A screenshot, or only a region: crop to what is being judged. |
| `window FILE` | The focused window alone (the preferences). |
| `overview on\|off` | Show or hide the overview; a `shot` or `click` outside `overview on` dismisses it. |

The same steps exist as single commands for a one-off. Also: `status`, `logs [N] [--all]`,
`mirror on|off`, `run CMD…` (against the nested bus and displays, never the real ones).

- **Keep a keyboard walk in one `do`**: each `do` makes a fresh virtual keyboard.
- **Never click or hover at the top-left**: the Activities hot corner.
- **A screen-sharing indicator in the top bar** is the input session's screencast, not a
  bug. Crop it off shots that are kept.
- **The preferences**: `./scripts/nested.sh run gnome-extensions prefs <uuid>` opens them
  inside the nested session. The Extensions app keeps the `prefs.js` it first imported;
  after an edit, kill the nested one (the process whose environment names this
  repository's nested Wayland display) before reopening, never a bare `pkill -f`.
- **Settings**: `./scripts/nested.sh run timeout 5 gsettings --schemadir src/schemas set
  org.gnome.shell.extensions.<name> KEY VALUE` changes the nested session's own settings
  at once, never the user's (`live-session.md`).

## When it looks wrong

`./scripts/nested.sh logs` first: a JS exception in `enable()` leaves the previous UI up
and reads as "no change". `logs 200 --all` shows the D-Bus and portal chatter too. Lines
with the extension's `[Name]` prefix are its own.

If the mirror will not open (it needs GStreamer's PipeWire plugin), use `--headless` and
screenshots, and tell the user.

**Headless without the mirror never paints** but for a screenshot: with nothing consuming
frames the compositor does not draw, so a CPU or GPU reading under `--headless` measures
nothing. Measure with the mirror on; it adds a constant screencast cost, so compare
readings with each other, not with zero.

## Screenshots that are kept

`docs/screenshots/` images are taken under `start --stand-in`, never of the user's own
collection, accounts or files: the `gnome-ext:screenshots` skill.

## Finishing

`./scripts/nested.sh stop` when the task is done or abandoned. Report what was checked,
which shots show it (paths in the scratchpad), and anything that looked wrong.
